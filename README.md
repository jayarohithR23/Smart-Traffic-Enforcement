## 🎯 What This Project Does

This intelligent system uses **Machine Learning** and **Computer Vision** to automatically detect motorcyclists without helmets and process license plates for automated fine collection. Built with state-of-the-art YOLO models, it's designed to enhance road safety and streamline traffic enforcement.

### ✨ Key Features
- 🪖 **Real-time Helmet Detection** - Identifies riders without helmets using YOLO v8
- 🚗 **License Plate Recognition** - Automated license plate detection and processing
- 📸 **Image & Video Processing** - Supports both static images and video streams
- 💰 **Automated Fine Collection** - Streamlined violation processing system
- 🌐 **Web Dashboard** - User-friendly interface for traffic officers
- 📊 **Analytics & Reports** - Comprehensive violation tracking and statistics
